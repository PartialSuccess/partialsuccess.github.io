<h3>Historical Perspective</h3>

<p>Our original loot system used a handful of rules, namely, items were distinguished into three queues of either General, Tier, or Weapon loot. Further, bind-on-equip items being assigned randomly under the mistaken assumption that these items would be extremely common.</p>

<p>This system 

As stated, we have moved to a set of new, fresh queues for Blackwing Lair separate from the ones for Molten Core. No initial queue order for these queues has been publically established, 

<p>All new, fresh Queues will be used for Blackwing Lair, separate from the ones for Molten Core (which will continue to be used.) Initial Queue position will be randomized except as noted below.</p>

<p><b>Consumables.</b> Use while progression raiding will grant a favorable initial Queue position over anyone who does not.</p>

<p><b>PvP Rankers.</b> As a result of hitting Rank 10 in PvP, certain classes free up a few raid drops to go to other players. As a reward for this effort, those players will receive favorable initial Queue positions.</p>

<p><b>Trial Raiders.</b> We have set the very low bar of reaching a 50th percentile parse for damage dealers in order to be promoted from Trial Raider to Core Raider. All else being equal, Core will begin in the queue above Trial.</p>

<p><b>Hunters.</b> The 8-piece Dragonstalker set bonus provides a debuff that makes raid bosses take more damage. As such, these items will be prioritized to Zetsumei. In exchange, he will be forgoing the first Crossbow upgrade.</p>

<p><b>System Changes.</b> We will otherwise be making only minor changes to the queue system.</p>
<ul>
<li>Caster/Healer weapons will be part of the General queue.</li>
<li>Certain items may count as Tier loot if they are used in place of Tier gear (notably, some caster/healer pants/boots.)</li>
<li>We will be adding a new non-bis Queue for items obtained "for free" for RP, PvP, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Priorization.</b> As always, you may find which classes receive priority on which items by checking out the guild spreadsheet.</p>

<p><b>Rings.</b> No one may receive a second best-in-slot ring until every other relevant character has received at least one best-in-slot ring, whether that ring is from Blackwing Lair or Molten Core.</p>

<p><b>Trinkets.</b> No one may receive a third trinket until every other relevant character has received at least two trinkets, whether that trinket is from Blackwing Lair or Molten Core.</p>

<h3>Crafting Preparations</h3>

<p>Materials should if at all possible be acquired now, before prices increase.</p>

<p><b>Druid/Paladin Healers.</b> All druid and paladin healers will want to obtain a <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/item=19162/corehound-belt">Corehound Belt</a>. You will need to obtain 10 Enchanted Leather, 4 Cured Rugged Hide, and 4 Ironweb Spider Silk.</p>

<p><b>Enchanters (+15 Agility to Weapon).</b> Enchanters will wish to hit at least Honored with <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/classic-wow-timbermaw-hold-reputation">Timbermaw Hold</a>.</p>

<p><b>Enchanters (+24 Healing to Bracers).</b> Enchanters will wish to hit Revered with <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/argent-dawn-reputation">Argent Dawn</a>.</p>
