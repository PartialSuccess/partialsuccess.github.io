        <h2>State of the Guild - 02/21/2020</h2>

<h4 style="text-align:center">We did it!</h4>

<h3>Guild Bank</h3>

<p>Alonsur now manages the bank as the character Taleb. Do not send materials to the old guild bank, as it is not available.</p>

<h3>Player vs. Player</h3>

<p>Talate has been leading us in World PvP for some time now, and I encourage everyone to take the opportunity to join him when he puts out the call. This is a good chance to not only take down some Horde, but to get to know some of the other players on the server such as the wonderful members of the Winterforge Clan or Strength &amp; Immortality.</p>

<p>Additionally, we have begun looking at forming a ten-man team for Warsung Gulch premades. If you have any interest in participating, reach out to either Alonsur or Falaris. We will be looking at using Wednesdays and Thursdays for these events.</p>

<h3>Raid Nights</h3>

<p>Our short-term plan is to use Sunday for Molten Core for at least another week or two, with the hope being that we eventually reach a point where we can comfortably clear both Blackwing Lair and Molten Core in a single Tuesday evening. If this proves more difficult than anticipated, we are likely to shift Molten Core to Wednesday evening.</p>

<p>In the long-term, it will not be possible to complete future raids such as Ahn'Qiraj in a single evening. As a result, Ahn'Qiraj will take place across Tuesday and Wednesday, while older raids will happen on Sunday.</p>

<h3>Queue Bonuses</h3>

<p>If you have not already done so, now is a good time to make sure you have acquired all best-in-slot crafted and quest gear, work on Alterac Valley reputation, and get all of your gear enchanted.</p>

<p>In the near future, possibly as soon as March 3rd, we will begin taking these efforts into account when deciding Queue position. I know I personally need this type of incentive, as I have not enchanted my gear.</p>

<h3>Loot Distribution</h3>

<p>A complete picture of loot distribution is forthcoming. In the mean-time, please use the information below as a guide and reach out to myself or an Officer with any questions.</p>

<p><b>Blackwing Lair.</b> As planned, we have new queues for Blackwing Lair. We have some new mechanisms to reward effort, in a manner not unlike EP/GP systems. Queues are not yet posted anywhere, beyond the results in the #loot-distribution channel. You may reach out to Alonsur if you want a more exacting explanation.</p>

<p><b>Progression Consumables.</b> The opportunity for flasking bonuses during progression is now over, with some players having earned up to 3/10ths of an item for flasking during our three progression raid days.</p>

<p><b>Item Priority.</b> Priorities are in the guild spreadsheet. These are the same as all other major guilds, built on thousands of hours of research from dozens of players across a decade of private server raiding, taking into account all current &amp; future content.</p>

<p><b>Item Types.</b> Items are now distinguished into three Queues for High, Mid, and Low quality items. With the addition of the Low-quality queue, we now track distribution of RP and PvP items.</p>

<p><b>Officer Discretion.</b> Officers may loot council any item, at any time, for any reason, with only a simple majority, provided that doing so does not allow the recipient to get more than two items ahead of another for a given loot type. The Guild Leader has absolute veto power for any reason or no reason to ignore this resolution and follow the Queue order.</p>

<p>You can assume that all melee weapons will be handled via Officer Discretion. Similarly, Zetsumei has established that Ashjre'thul, Crossbow of Smiting will be awarded to the highest parsing Hunter other than himself.</p>

<h3>Departures</h3>

<p>Wander is now largely unavailable due to being in Europe for the next three months, hence the change of hands on the guild bank. Will he return to us when all is said and done? Time will tell.</p>

<p>Meowntain &amp; Sproles transferred with their friend Gurkel to play on Grobbulus. As these two are not having the best of times on Grobbulus, we may yet see one or more of them back on Deviate Delight in the future...</p>

<p>Burningman has also been forced to take a leave from raiding, due to his commitments with the Canadian military. Short notice, unfortunately, but we wish him the best of luck!</p>

<p>Roic will also be stepping back a bit, as his schedule made it difficult to manage weekday raids (he had to raid, and then rush to Soccer practice!)</p>

<p>Kelharath has never really enjoyed playing on a PvP realm, having been annoyed that we dragged him here, and has chosen to step away from the game for now.</p>

<h3>Raid Roster</h3>

<p>We have brought on Fatherrick and Nostalgiated as Trial Raiders.</p>

<p>If you are thinking about stepping away from the game or would like to switch your status to Alternate, let me know.</p>
