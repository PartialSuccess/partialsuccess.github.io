        <h2>State of the Guild - 9/3/2019</h2>
<p>Congratulations to all on our one <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/words-were-watching-iversary" target="_blank">weekiversary</a>!</p>

<p>The existence of &lt;Partial Success&gt; is a surprise, having unexpectedly split off from our friends in &lt;Origins&gt; in light of the server-choosing crisis and other transparency concerns. It may be that our friends will rejoin us some day. Should that occur, I expect nothing but graciousness on our part - I for one have no hard feelings.</p>

<p>For those of you who remember &lt;Quantum Entanglement&gt;, note that we are graced by returning members Jbaum, Kevrok (Kelharath), Medvedev, Roka (Rokaa), Pantokrator (Roic), Spamhamsteak (Delos), and Veggieburgr (Cam).</p>

<h3>Leadership</h3>

<p>We have a mix of old and new faces as Officers.</p>

<p><h4>Jay (Alonsur)</h4> 31 y/o Software Engineer from near Milwaukee, Wisconsin with previous experience running a guild during the game's first three expansions. I own a house, which I bought so that I would have a place to store my 3000+ D&amp;D miniatures.</p>

<p><h4>Spam (Delos)</h4> Long-time friend of Jay, he offers a stabilizing voice unafraid to tell the Emperor when he's about to walk out onto the streets without any clothes on. Has otherwise paid his dues and now spends his days linking <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/item=5504/tangy-clam-meat">Tangy Clam Meat</a> in guild chat.</p>

<p><h4>Sam (Algorilla)</h4> A kind-hearted individual, he offers a uniquely pure &amp; innocent perspective despite a degenerate sense of humor. Wields his mighty Christian missionizing skills to engage in levels of guild recruitment hitherto thought impossible.</p>

<p><h4>Vick</h4> An experienced private server raider, Vick brings copious knowledge of raiding classic content in the context of a modern understanding of the World of Warcraft. He has reluctantly but happily accepted an Officer position, joining us via Jbaum.</p>

<p><h4>Safyrae (Eiralyn)</h4> Long-time gamer and knower-of-80s-movies, she has been brought on to help align our moral compass and curb our worst impulses. You wouldn't know it from her confidence in-game, but Safyrae is a shy one! She joins us along with her husband, Nimiodomera, at least until they can't put up with us any longer.</p>

<p><h4>Aelari</h4> Mother, hardcore gamer, and actual-vanilla-Naxx-raider: she brings a wide array of unique skills to the table. Alongside her brother-from-another-mother Turaden (Taggart), these two are an indispensible resource to our up-and-coming guild (read: please, don't scare them away.)</p>

<p><h4>Turaden (Taggart)</h4> Father, hardcore gamer, and master of player vs. player action: he rounds out the guild by being a <i>literal</i> Chad with real world management experience. Another indispensible resource alongside Aelari.</p>

<h3>Conduct</h3>

<p>To reiterate our conduct policy: "Members will conduct themselves with dignity & respect. Please refrain from language that would be inappropriate in an office, church, in front of your grandparents, or when speaking to a God."</p>

<p>Our first /gkick was Jyp, who engaged in trolling by attempting to create a Deadmines group at level 10, despite repeatedly being told this was not a good idea. This is annoying and disrespectful to others.</p>

<p>Our second /gkick was Woopingu, who committed two sins: first, he crassly brought politics into guild chat in a targeted &amp; insulting way, and secondly, he failed to comprehend that our conduct policy is referencing Ghostbusters. Our guild leadership (mostly) does not believe itself to be the recipient of divine mandates.</p>

<p>Please leave politics out of guild chat. All officers have authority to take disciplinary action as required to enforce this. Being a friend of the GM does not make you immune to this rule.</p>

<p>Additionally, when a recent member left in order to join an RP guild instead, they first posted a kind message before their departure. Unfortunately, when someone joked "Nerd!" this triggered a pile-on which included longer, more unpleasant comments. As a result, Marbella was disgusted and gquit.</p>

<p>First of all - I get the idea, it was a joke. But this really made us look like a bunch of stupid assholes. We should endeavor in the future to maintain at least a bit more semi-professional atmosphere. Please don't respond to earnestly offered kind words with sarcastic mean-spirited humor.</p>

<h3>Goals</h3>

<p>Our immediate goal is to simply level up and enjoy the game. Classic is back, baby! Level 60 is a long, long ways away and we wouldn't want to spoil the journey too much by worrying overmuch about raiding.</p>

<p>That said, please be on the lookout for other players who you feel would be a good fit for the guild. I would like to keep the guild as small and tight-knit as possible, within the confines of the practical considerations of fielding a 40(!) person raiding roster.</p>

<p>If you are planning to raid, please note that our raid times are currently set for 8-11pm server on Tuesdays and Wednesdays, with Sunday as a backup/optional/flex day. If that time frame does not work for you, now's your chance to get out. If you're in CST like me, that's 7-10pm. I would not expect this window to shift by any more than thirty minutes at most, if at all. It is not inconceivable that we would switch to Tuesday/Thursday, but doing so would require the unanimous agreement of all the Officers and probably most of the people who want to raid.</p>

<p>You can sign up for raiding by <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/2P8PVXD" target="_blank">clicking here</a>. We will be posting clarification as to exact plans for loot distribution soon.</p>

<p>In the future, you can expect monthly contests, guild events, and especially organized Player vs. Player outings. If you are interested in running or co-ordinating events of this nature, please contact an Officer.</p>
