        <h2>State of the Guild - 01/21/2020</h2>
		
<p>2020 is here and that means preparation Blackwing Lair. Buckle up.</p>

<p><b style="color: red;">"too long, didn't read version" - get four flasks to cover two weeks of progression raiding, and get attuned for Blackwing Lair!</b></p>

<h3>Release &amp; Attunement</h3>

<p>Blackwing Lair will release on <b style="color: palegreen;">Wednesday, February 12th</b> as part of the <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/news=305109/classic-wow-content-drop-on-feb-12th-blackwing-lair-level-50-class-quests-eterna">Phase 3 Content Patch</a>. Thus, we raid Molten Core as normal on Tuesday and enter Blackwing Lair on Wednesday (hopefully concluding on Sunday.)</p>

<p><a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/blackwing-lair-attunement-blackhands-command-classic-wow">Attunement for Blackwing Lair</a> is available now, and everyone must be attuned. All you need is to get a quest item and then run Upper Blackrock Spire. Once attuned, let Jbaum know.</p>

<p>While progression raiding, we may go over our raid time by up to thirty minutes (up to 11:30pm) if we feel it is in the best interests of the raid.</p>

<h3>Preparation</h3>

<p>
Progression raiding lasts two weeks, for four total raid nights, and we would ask everyone to bring consumables including four flasks (one for each night.)</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Melee</b> - Flask of the Titans, Mongoose Elixirs</li>
<li><b>Casters</b> - Flask of Supreme Power, Arcane/Shadow Elixirs, Mana Potions</li>
<li><b>Healers</b> - Flask of Distilled Wisdom, Dark Runes, Mana Potions</li>
<li><b>Everyone</b> - Health Potions and Stratholme Holy Water!</li>
</ul>

<h3>Loot Queue</h3>

<p>All new, fresh Queues will be used for Blackwing Lair, separate from the ones for Molten Core (which will continue to be used.) Initial Queue position will be randomized except as noted below.</p>

<p><b>Consumables.</b> Use while progression raiding will grant a favorable initial Queue position over anyone who does not.</p>

<p><b>PvP Rankers.</b> As a result of hitting Rank 10 in PvP, certain classes free up a few raid drops to go to other players. As a reward for this effort, those players will receive favorable initial Queue positions.</p>

<p><b>Trial Raiders.</b> We have set the very low bar of reaching a 50th percentile parse for damage dealers in order to be promoted from Trial Raider to Core Raider. All else being equal, Core will begin in the queue above Trial.</p>

<p><b>Hunters.</b> The 8-piece Dragonstalker set bonus provides a debuff that makes raid bosses take more damage. As such, these items will be prioritized to Zetsumei. In exchange, he will be forgoing the first Crossbow upgrade.</p>

<p><b>System Changes.</b> We will otherwise be making only minor changes to the queue system.</p>
<ul>
<li>Caster/Healer weapons will be part of the General queue.</li>
<li>Certain items may count as Tier loot if they are used in place of Tier gear (notably, some caster/healer pants/boots.)</li>
<li>We will be adding a new non-bis Queue for items obtained "for free" for RP, PvP, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Priorization.</b> As always, you may find which classes receive priority on which items by checking out the guild spreadsheet.</p>

<p><b>Rings.</b> No one may receive a second best-in-slot ring until every other relevant character has received at least one best-in-slot ring, whether that ring is from Blackwing Lair or Molten Core.</p>

<p><b>Trinkets.</b> No one may receive a third trinket until every other relevant character has received at least two trinkets, whether that trinket is from Blackwing Lair or Molten Core.</p>

<h3>Crafting Preparations</h3>

<p>Materials should if at all possible be acquired now, before prices increase.</p>

<p><b>Druid/Paladin Healers.</b> All druid and paladin healers will want to obtain a <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/item=19162/corehound-belt">Corehound Belt</a>. You will need to obtain 10 Enchanted Leather, 4 Cured Rugged Hide, and 4 Ironweb Spider Silk.</p>

<p><b>Enchanters (+15 Agility to Weapon).</b> Enchanters will wish to hit at least Honored with <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/classic-wow-timbermaw-hold-reputation">Timbermaw Hold</a>.</p>

<p><b>Enchanters (+24 Healing to Bracers).</b> Enchanters will wish to hit Revered with <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/argent-dawn-reputation">Argent Dawn</a>.</p>
