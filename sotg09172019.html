        <h2>State of the Guild - 9/17/2019</h2>
        
<p>Congratulations everyone on our recent achievements: 165+ members on the in-game roster (probably half of that is alts), 20 on our full-time raiding roster, and 11 on our part-time raiding roster. I know there are several folks in the guild who intend to raid but have not yet signed-up - please do so, or encourage others to do so if you know they are interested.</p>

<h3>Officer Notes &amp; Discord</h3>

<p>Within game, I have promoted folks from Initiate to Member if I have a general idea of who you are. Where possible, I have added a guild note with "a-o" alt-of, "c-o" care-of, or "r-b" recruited-by. If you do not have a note, let an Officer know.</p>

<p>Within Discord, I have marked folks as Member if I know who you are. Please add your username to your Discord nickname if it is not there already.</p>

<h3>Recruiting</h3>

<p>Our initial period of open, aggressive recruitment has ended. Moving forward, we should aim to recruit people we group with. Anyone with Member rank has the ability to /ginvite, and several of you have taken advantage of this already. Thanks to everyone for their past and future efforts in this area.</p>

<p>Note that we are especially interested in recruiting priests, rogues, and warriors.</p>

<h3>Raid Loot</h3>

<p>We will be moving forward with our decision to use Loot Council and we will be taking on the effort of pre-determining who will receive what loot. As previously stated, this should mostly resemble a point system in the form of a simplified queue - that is, attendance & loot received are the dominating factors for loot distribution. If you are signed up for our raiding roster by the end of this month, you will safely be considered part of the founding raid crew.</p>

<p>In an effort to avoid scandal when we have our first raid, the initial queue order will be randomized rather than preferencing any particular person within the founding crew. If for any reason any group of loot recipients would prefer to defer loot to someone else, avoid certain pieces, or what have you, we can discuss closer to when we are actually ready to raid.</p>

<h3>Professions &amp; Craftsman</h3>

<p>Within game, public notes should be used to specify professions. These should be Ec, Eg, Bs, Ta, Al, He, Mi, or Sk. If you are Member+ or above, you can set these notes. Please fill these out if you can, or help others do so. Crafting professions should be listed before gathering professions.</p>

<p>We will be electing designated crafters in the near future - these folks will preferentially receive world drops and raid drops. Realistically, you can probably already guess who these folks will be based on their exemplary efforts so far in establishing their professions. Cue sidelong glances at folks like Jbaum and Merindui.</p>

<h3>Atmosphere &amp; Reputation</h3>

<p>I want to thank everyone for their efforts fostering a delightful atmosphere in guild chat, and especially for establishing a positive outward reputation for the guild. We have come a ways from our rough and tumble first week! It is a joy to see everyone co-operate, helping one another, and sharing items in guild.</p>

<p>I also want to give a special shout-out to various folks. Bringtherain was mentioned positively by Monte in Trade Chat, Koganusan &amp; Karkadann provided the final push needed for Phx to jump into our guild, and after a positive run with Delos, Harbard, and Xinghua, we had Ezforthemack join as well. I am certain others have contributed similarly, but these are the specific cases I knew about!</p>
