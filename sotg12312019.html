        <h2>State of the Guild - 12/31/2019</h2>
		
<p>Well... we've made it through the first four months of Classic and the whole of 2019 intact with only the deaths of a few e-sons to weigh on our consciences. Here's to you guys, and to the year ahead of us! If you've decided to spend the evening indoors - please join us in Stormwind for the fireworks when Midnight rolls around.</p>

<p>Being promoted to the core raid team is based on several factors such as sociability, reliability, and desire. For performance, we are requiring trial raiders to reach a parse at or above the 50th percentile before promotion.</p>

<h3>World Bosses</h3>

<p>In order to alert others and be alerted of world bosses, please download the <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/silver-dragon/files/2781945">Silverdragon Addon</a> and enter the numbers 6109 for Azuregos and 12397 for Kazzak. The more people who created level 1 alts (or better yet level 20 warlock alts) to scout world bosses, the better. If you need any help at all, please reach out to Jbaum.</p>

<p>World boss loot is being handled outside the Queue system, with priority going to the most active scouters. I encourage thinking of this loot as bonus loot that helps the guild. As part of our agreement with the other guilds, all recipients are to be determined in advance to speed loot distribution along - any randomness I have added to the distribution order is pre-determined. If you have any specific concerns surrounding world boss loot, please contact me directly.</p>

<h3>Raid Momentum</h3>

<p>For reasons of personal pride and server notoriety, we have a strong desire to achieve a clear time in Molten Core of 90 minutes, at least once. Our current record is 102 minutes and we generally land within 5 minutes of that time.</p>

<p>At the moment, the greatest possible increase to our speed will come from continuing to pull bosses without delay. To that end I would encourage everyone to maintain buffs as often as possible and to not delay boss pulls due to buffs.</p>

<h3>Miscellaneous</h3>

<p>We now have a #schedule channel in Discord for you to mark your expected absences.</p>

<p>We have a Free Trade Agreement with &lt;and the boys&gt; - that means tips only, which goes both ways.</p>
