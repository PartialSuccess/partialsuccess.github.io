        <h2>Bonus State of the Guild - 09/24/2019 (?)</h2>

<p>Happy <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Tuesday</span> Wednesday, everyone. The State of the Guild is intended to be a bi-monthly update, but in these heady early days where life comes at you fast, I have opted for a bonus update. Until I get around to improving the site organization, here are links for the <a href="sotg09172019.html" target="_blank">09/17/2019 update</a> and the <a href="sotg09032019.html" target="_blank">09/03/2019 update</a>.</p>

<h3>Discord Organization</h3>

<p>We have several new channels.</p>

<ul>
<li>#special-operations has been opened to discuss and plan player vs. player action, and we have been enjoying ourselves in the Gurubashi Arena of Stranglethorn Vale under Talate's murderous tutelage</li>
<li>#raiding has been moved up to be one of the main channels, worth a look if you hope to raid</li>
<li>#member-forum has been opened as a members-only channel to discuss chili recipes and tell embarassing life stories</li>
</ul>

<h3>Officers</h3>

<p>Due to availability concerns, I accepted an offer from Safyrae to step down as an Officer. I promoted Safyrae to Officer in the first place to provide a voice to those in the guild who are not primarily focused on raiding. Are we now doomed to a future of becoming a guild of hardcore goons who care only for the hollow joy of looting purples?</p>

<h3>Fresh Faces</h3>

<p>We gained several new members on the evening of Monday the 23rd. The story of these fellows is similar to our own: launch day became a quagmire of queue times and new server openings, and a bunch of folks who had intended to play with one another ended up on different realms. After a bit of shopping around, Daryl and his sister Laurah determined that we would be the best fit for their crew (indeed, Pwent and Xinghua had already made the jump.)</p>

<h3>Raiding Roster</h3>

<p>Our <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQFUtw3TpHEs5SHkV5jsX-TUgmZe2Sy8775IMZaKbTJsNat3Ld8cAJKDGq6JLgHaRF5Qx9uxonjN6-Q/pubhtml#" target="_blank">roster</a> is now in amazing shape, with 28 full-time signups and 11 part-time signups. If you or anyone you know have not joined Discord or <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/2P8PVXD" target="_blank">signed-up for raiding</a>, please do so. After the month of September, we will no longer be able to guarantee a full-time raiding spot for everyone who signs up.</p>

<p>I apologize for any confusion over the terms full-time and part-time, as these were not adequately explained. The intent is that if you can commit to regularly attending on both Tuesday and Wednesday, you are full-time. In any other situation, such as being able to commit to only one day or being only intermittently available, you are part-time.</p>

<h3>Pickup Raiding</h3>

<p>We are scheduling a pickup raid group for Sunday the 20th of October, to be planned and executed by us. I am projecting about 15 or 20 members to be raid ready by that time. We will be providing a calendar mechanism for sign-ups in the near future. If you hope to attend, you will need to be at least level 55 and <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/molten-core-classic-attunement" target="_blank">attuned for Molten Core.</a></p>

<p>We are on the lookout for another guild to partner with for pickup runs, for one or two weeks. Any help in arranging this would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<h3>Etiquette</h3>

<p>I want to once again encourage everyone to keep guild chat clean &amp; tight. The golden rule is: "Members will conduct themselves with dignity &amp; respect. Please refrain from language that would be inappropriate in an office, church, in front of your grandparents, or when speaking to a God."</p>

<p>If you can express yourself on one line instead of twenty, please do so. If your mother has given you free reign to eat all the candy you want, burn your sugar rush off without spamming guild chat. If you feel compelled to make weiner jokes (weiners being notoriously and understandably humorous by their nature as weiners) make them in party chat. If you are infuriated and catharsis demands you punch the keys for God's sake to create a stream of filth, send it to Algorilla.</p>
