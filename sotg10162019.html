        <h2>State of the Guild - 10/16/2019</h2>

<p>We are closing in on a major milestone to secure our place on the server - hosting a successful Molten Core pickup raid.</p>

<p>Just kidding. We secured our place on the server already by representing ourselves with dignity &amp; aplomb in all of our interactions with others. I have received compliments from numerous players outside the guild on how fun, talented, and good-natured everyone from our guild has been. Keep up the good work!</p>

<h3>Class Captains</h3>

<p>We now have Class Captains! These folks help manage a classic-sized raiding guild, that the GM may retain his sanity.</p>

<table style="margin: 0 auto;">
<tbody>
<tr class="druid"><td>Druids</td><td>Aelari</td>
<tr class="hunter"><td>Hunters</td><td>Zetsumei</td>
<tr class="mage"><td>Mages</td><td>Helinos</td>
<tr class="rogue"><td>Rogues</td><td>Falaris</td>
<tr class="paladin"><td>Paladins</td><td>Taggart</td>
<tr class="priest "><td>Priests</td><td>Wander</td>
<tr class="warlock"><td>Warlocks</td><td>Jbaum</td>
<tr class="warrior"><td>Warriors (deeps)</td><td>Daryl</td>
<tr class="warrior"><td>Warriors (tanks)</td><td>Vick</td>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>Captains are primarily a raid-focused position, helping <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/debuff-management-classic-wow" target="_blank">plan debuffs,</a> <a href="https://shorturl.at/aboyN" target="_blank">confirm attendance</a>, or otherwise help players make the most of their class. If you have any issues, these players are here for you.</p>

<h3>Molten Core Pickup</h3>

<p>We will be plundering the depths of Molten Core from 8pm to 11pm server on Sunday the 20th. Make sure to get your <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/classic-wow-attunements-and-keys-dungeons-raids#attunement-to-the-core-molten-core" target="_blank">atunement on</a> and help others hit 60. We are in great shape and the raid is a-go!</p>

<h3>Player of the Week</h3>

<p>This week we recognize <b class="warrior">Xinghua</b> for his extraordinary willingness to go above and beyond in helping guildies in dungeons and making everyone in the guild feel valued, especially as our focus has lately been oriented towards raiding. Thanks for all your help making the guild what it is today, and keeping us on the straight and narrow.</p>

<h3>Future Plans</h3>

<ul>
<li><b>Discord Updates!</b> class colors, automated raid attendance, fewer channels(?)</li>
<li><b>Website Updates!</b> re-organization, more content, up-to-date info</li>
<li><b>Guild Events!</b> social gatherings, server out-reach, roleplay events(!?)</li>
<li><b>Guild Contests!</b> monthly contests with goals achievable by any player</li>
</ul>
