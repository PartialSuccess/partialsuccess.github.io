        <h2>State of the Guild - 10/08/2019</h2>

<p>Wow! We've been playing for over a month now, and I am personally burned out from the every-waking-second playstyle. If you are feeling <a href="https://www.helpguide.org/articles/stress/burnout-prevention-and-recovery.htm" target="_blank">burned out</a>, I would suggest taking a few days off or playing less entirely. I will be taking a few days off myself this week to put my home in order, as it is currently a disaster area.</p>

<p>Given potential burnout, I would be curious to hear from anyone on the subject of our pickup raids later this month. Do you feel we're moving too fast? Or maybe you feel we're not moving fast enough? Let me know what you think!</p>
</p>

<h3>Guild Bank</h3>

<p>Our guild bank is named Psbank and is operated by Wander. At the moment, we require <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/item=7068/elemental-fire" target="_blank">Elemental Fires</a> &amp; <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/item=13463/dreamfoil" target="_blank">Dreamfoil</a> to craft Greater Fire Resistance Potions, which will be distributed to the raid while facing down Ragnaros.</p>

<p>If you wish to keep a found recipe in-guild, send it to the guild bank to ensure sound distribution.</p>

<h3>Roster Maintenance</h3>

<p>Jbaum maintains our <a href="https://shorturl.at/aboyN" target="_blank">guild spreadsheet</a>, and would like to know about your crafting professions and raid attunements. Please contact him with information your profession specializations or rare recipes, and let him know once you have completed attunements for either Molten Core or Onyxia.</p>

<h3>Pickup Raiding</h3>

<p>From 8pm to 11pm server on Sunday the 20th, we will be hosting a pickup raid for Molten Core. Anyone <a href="https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/classic-wow-attunements-and-keys-dungeons-raids#attunement-to-the-core-molten-core" target="_blank">attuned</a> and level 55+ is welcome to join us. We will be fielding all the tanks and many of the healers. I am in contact with other players and guilds to ensure we have a full raid. I am expecting to clear the first eight bosses of Molten Core.</p>

<p>If you wish to attend, please inform an Officer or Captain, as we do not have an automated sign-up mechanism just yet. Plan to show up half an hour early, if possible.</p>

<h3>Recruiting</h3>

<p>At the moment, we are on the lookout for any class but Paladin. In particular, we could use a few more priest or druid healers, and additional rogues. We are also interested in players who do not intend to raid but would be happy to be a part of a raiding guild, and fill-in when circumstances allow.</p>

<h3>Etiquette &amp; Naming</h3>

<p>I have been pleased with etiquette in guild chat, and our most obnoxious recruits have been scared away. I would ask that when it comes to alts, that you continue to create characters with <a href="https://us.battle.net/support/en/article/135764" target="_blank">roleplay-friendly names</a>, as we are on a roleplaying server. If your name is not roleplay-friendly and you wish to change it, I suggest you open a customer service ticket.</p>

<p>Obviously, don't pick a name that would be banned on any server, flout Blizzard's ban by slightly changing the spelling, and then act surprised when offense is taken. Not that anything like that would happen here.</p>

<h3>Departures</h3>

<p>The past week saw the departure several couples: <span title="left shortly after professing their love for the guild, mostly because of Melaya">Kaliban &amp; Leatrixi</span>, <span title="guild was not sufficiently Canadian">Koganusan &amp; Karkadann</span>, <span title="unable to put up with one more second of mansplaining">Safyrae &amp; Nimiodomera</span>, as well as <span title="not really sure who these two were or how they were recruited">Rhonto, Martyr</span>, and later on <span title="for the love of god Jbaum why did you give this person all those recipes">Melaya</span>. All are wished the best of luck in their future endeavours.</p>

<p>None of these departures affect the core of the guild or our raid team. What is affected is our number of non-raiders, who are often helpful in making raid teams effective. Recruitment efforts will address this, and everyone in the guild is encouraged to recruit well met adventurers.</p>

<p>If you have any questions about specific departures, you may contact Alonsur or another Officer.</p>
