        <h2>State of the Guild - 11/20/2019</h2>

<p></p>

<h3>Leadership</h3>

<p>We have simplified the leadership structure, eliminating the role of Officer in favor of simply having Class Captains, plus myself and Delos. This change merely formalizes our existing decision-making process.</p>

<h3>Raid Formation</h3>

<p>With over forty persons looking to raid, we have added the Raider rank above Member+. This rank is reserved for players who are active, well-liked, performing well, and punctual. We have no immediate vacancies for Raider positions. Below you will find our thirty-four current raiders, our six trial raiders, and our six alternates.</p>

<p>Below is our current set of Raiders:</p>

<table style="margin: 0 auto;">

<tr class="druid"><td>Druids</td><td>Aelari, Minerva, Selnath, Serethiel, Rhonto</td>
<tr class="hunter"><td>Hunters</td><td>Dondante, Harbard, Roic, Zetsumei</td>

<h3>Onyxia Schedule</h3>

<p>The Onyxia schedule for the remainder of the year is posted in the #raiding channel in Discord. Onyxia resets every five days, and we have chosen to slay her as often as possible. As a result, the guild will see 40% more Onyxia loot compared with killing her once per week. If you cannot attend Sundays, you will still benefit via less competition for loot on Wednesdays.</p>

<h3>Holidays</h3>

<p>Please inform Jbaum, myself, or your Class Captain if you will be unavailable for an extended period of time. We will not be raiding at our regular times during the last two weeks of December; we will most likely form a pickup raid on the weekend.</p>

<h3>Miscellaneous</h3>

<p>Class colors in Discord proved too heinous to gaze upon, and were removed.</p>

<p>Jbaum is currently rescheduling the costume contest, and we hope to have other events in the future.</p>

<p>Ostensibly, I will release State of the Guilds at least once per month and update the website as well.</p>

<p>Automated raid signups have proven unnecessary - we may revisit this topic once Zul'gurub is released as 20-man raids will not be incorporated into our usual schedule.</p>
